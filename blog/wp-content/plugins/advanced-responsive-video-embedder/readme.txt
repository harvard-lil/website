== Description ==

[Demo/examples here](http://my-hardware.net/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/demo/)

= Features =

* Responsive embeds
* Max-width if you like
* 4 Different modes how to embed Videos
* Colorbox integration for thumb mode
* Make embeds float with align=right/left

= Modes =

* Normal mode: Responsible embeds automatically resized to 100% of your content area. You can set up a max-width if you
dont want to let the video bigger then you like it.

* Thumb mode: This requires jquery colorbox to be loaded, the easiest way to get it by installing the 'jquery colorbox' Wordpress Plugin. This simply transforms your shortcodes into a thumbnail when you click on it it will open a big video in a colorbox. It will get thumbnails from providers that support them, for all other providers it will get the normal embed but a layer with a link on top of it to mimic a thumbnail.

* Fixed mode: Not recommended. This is how the traditional plugins do it. Embed Videos with a fixed sizes. You can setup 
the size in the Options. If you like you can use shortcode let the plugin create single fixed embeds without any setup.

* Special mode: This will put out the video without any wrapper but with a css class for users to style themselves. Most
likely you will not need this.

= Supported video sites =

* YouTube
* Google Video
* Metacafe
* Liveleak

= Usage =

`[bliptv id=AfGXPAI]` 

This should be all you need most of the time. It uses the default mode and settings from the options.

`[bliptv id=AfGXPAI mode=normal]`

This will create a resposive embed with in the 'normal' mode. If you have set up a max-width, this will setup the maximal width as well.

`[metacafe id=237147 mode=normal maxw=500]`

This will override max-width setting from the options (if any) 

`[metacafe id=237147 mode=thumb]`

This will create a thumbnail with the width you have set in options. This Thumbnail will open a jquery colorbox
with your big video in it.

`[metacafe id=237147 w=400 h=300]`

This will automatically switch to 'fixed' mode and create a NOT responsive fixed sized embed.

`[metacafe id=237147 align=left]`

Makes a video align left - you guessed it.

= Notice this =

The id of a video is easy to find in the providers url. For example ww.metacafe.com/watch/**237147**/9_11_alex_jones_and_charlie_sheen_interview/.
But for some this providers you need to get the id from the embed code

= Exceptions for getting the id from the embed code instead of the url =

* blip: <iframe src="http://blip.tv/play/**g45ggoykLAI**.html?p=1" [...]
* videojug: <object [...] /player?id=**e37b3839-21e4-de7d-f6ee-ff0008ca2ccd**"></param> [...]
