= About WordPress Auto-embeds =

WordPress has a nifty auto-embed feature, allowing authors to automatically turn a link to a video embed into a video player when a post is viewed. To turn this feature on check the **Auto-embeds** check box in **Administration > Settings > Media SubPanel**.

= Under the hood =

Please note that this plugins modifies the output of `modify_embed_output` filter, adding HTML & CSS to make the magic happen.

Credit for the method used in this plugin goes to [Anders M. Andersen](http://amobil.se/2011/11/responsive-embeds/) for crafting the method used to gracefully resize the embeds.

= Multisite Compatibility =

The *Responsive Video Embeds* plugin is compatibly with WordPress Multisite, just use the [Network Activate](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network#WordPress_Plugins) feature to enable responsive video resizing embed on every site. If you only want responsive video resizing to happen on a specific site, activate the plugin for that site only.

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the folder `responsive-video-embeds` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In the WordPress admin, enable the **Auto-embeds** feature under the **Settings > Media** menu.
